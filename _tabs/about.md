## 👀 About Me:
I’m Danny, a technical writer and editor with over six years of experience in print and digital publishing. I offer services in UX writing, technical writing, copywriting, copyediting, developmental editing, and proofreading. Whether crafting microcopy, writing a how-to guide, or copyediting a manuscript, I know how to distill complex ideas into simple, accessible language. <br/><br/>
In addition to the best practices I learned in the University of Washington Professional Technical Writing program, I follow the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach to technical documentation. This approach identifies four distinct user needs, and four corresponding forms of documentation: tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation. Diátaxis is a simple framework that solves problems related to documentation content (*what to write*), style (*how to write it*), and architecture (*how to organize it*).
