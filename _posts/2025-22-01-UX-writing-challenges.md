## Introduction
I put my UX writing skills to the test with Ryan Farrell’s [Daily UX Writing Challenges](https://dailyuxwriting.com/). The following is a sample of responses that I mocked up in Figma.  
I found some of the character limits needlessly confining and unrealistic. Brevity at the cost of clarity and usability is a UX no-no. Nevertheless, whenever I flouted character limits, I provided two solutions: one within the limits and a longer version that I deemed more user-friendly.

## Flight Cancellation Message
### Scenario
A traveler is in an airport waiting for the last leg of a flight home when their flight gets abruptly canceled due to bad weather.
Write a message from the airline app notifying them of the cancellation and what they need to do next.    
**Headline:** 45 characters max  
**Body:** 175 characters max  
**Button(s):** 25 characters max

### Why This Solution Works  
The microcopy balances empathy, clarity, and user empowerment, making a frustrating experience more manageable.  
#### Empathy and Transparency:
- Opening with an acknowledgment of the inconvenience builds trust and shows empathy.
- Explaining the reason for cancellation (bad weather) reassures travelers it’s out of the airline’s control.
- Explaining that there is no advantage to contacting a Reservations specialist saves users time and effort—avoiding unnecessary trips to the check-in desk, re-clearing security, or frustrating phone calls—while easing the load on customer support.
#### Clarity and Simplicity:
- Two clear options are provided up front, with easy-to-understand language and no ambiguity about the next steps.
#### Actionable CTAs:  
- The "Find a New Flight" button encourages quick action for those who need to rebook.
- Reassuring that a refund will be automatic (with a timeline) prevents confusion or additional effort for the user.
#### Positive Framing:
- Instead of focusing solely on the inconvenience, the message emphasizes solutions and safety, softening the blow of the cancellation. Even the heading is encouraging, giving the user a feeling of empowerment rather than defeat. 
#### Accessibility:
- Short sentences, simple language ('bad' not 'inclement', 'new flight' not 'alternative flight'), straightforward instructions, and optional customer support links make the message accessible to all users, regardless of stress levels or language proficiency.


## Sports App Promo Screen
By balancing clarity, relevance, and a compelling CTA, this solution is designed to attract users and encourage them to engage with the app immediately.
### Scenario
A user is a working parent, and a big sports fan, in the midst of their favorite sports season who can no longer attend games.  
Write a promotional screen for an app that lets a user choose teams, sends game reminders, real-time score updates and highlight videos.    
**Headline:** 40 characters max  
**Body:** 175 characters max  
**Button(s):** 25 characters max     
![Sports app promo screen](/imgs/UX writing challenges/sports app promo screen.png)  
### Why This Solution Works  
#### Tailored to the User's Situation:
The header directly addresses the target audience: sports fans who can't attend games but still want to stay connected. It emphasizes that they can follow their favorite team no matter where they are, resonating with the user's lifestyle.
#### Concise and Impactful Body Copy:
The body copy is short, to the point, and covers the app’s core features: game reminders, score updates, and highlight reels. It avoids unnecessary detail while clearly communicating the app's value.
#### Appealing to the On-the-Go User:
By mentioning “sports fans on the move,” it aligns with busy adults who need a quick, efficient way to stay updated.
#### Action-Oriented CTA:
The button, “Try FanAddict Free,” is simple, enticing, and encourages immediate action. Highlighting that the app is free lowers the barrier to entry and motivates users to give it a shot.
#### Effective Use of Space:
The copy is minimal yet effective, making it easy to scan quickly, which is perfect for users with limited time and attention.

## Wrong email address error message
### Scenario
The user entered the wrong email address to sign in to their account. Tell the user to enter the right email.  
**40 characters max**   
![Flight Cancellation](/imgs/tvh-ux-writing/homepage-hero-pre-2-0_orig.jpg)  
### Rationale
The best solution to this error is good design and development. Visual aids, such as a red outline around the form field, are more effective than clear UX writing. If we can tell users whether an incorrect email or an incorrect password caused the error, even better.   
“We don’t recognize that email” is better than “Incorrect email address” for two reasons: 1) It takes the blame off the user. *You didn’t do anything wrong. We just don’t recognize that email address.* 2) The email address might be correct, but it might not be associated with an account on this website. In this scenario, I would also point out to developers that we must include a "Create Account" button because if users enter their email address correctly and realize they don't have an account on the platform, they need to an option to create one.  
Finally, I didn’t use words such as “Oops” or “Hmm” because—as a person who often enters the wrong email or password—I find these whimsical words annoying.

## Grocery home delivery promo overlay
### Scenario
A user is in their favorite supermarket. They open the supermarket’s app on their phone to see what’s on sale and are greeted by a promotion. Write a promotional home screen for a subscription service that delivers groceries to the user once a month for a flat fee.
  
**Headline:** 45 characters max  
**Body:** 175 characters max  
**Button(s):** 25 characters max      
![Flight Cancellation](/imgs/tvh-ux-writing/homepage-hero-pre-2-0_orig.jpg)  
### Rationale
Again, this is more copywriting than UX writing. The headline is attention-grabbing and mentions the main message of the promo: grocery delivery.  
I used some sneaky psychology tactics in this overlay: FOMO. Most people—myself included—will click “Remind me later” when given the choice to sign up for something. If a decision isn’t important and I’m busy (shopping), I’ll likely put it off until later. But I didn’t give the user the option to tap "Remind me later". Instead, I tried to make them feel anxious about declining the offer. If users say "No, thanks" to this promotion now, they might never get a chance to sign up for grocery delivery or get the first month of deliveries free.  The fear of missing out on a limited-time opportunity is extremely powerful.

## A fiery push notification
### Scenario
It’s Monday. A user has just gotten into their car to drive to work. They plug their phone into the car and start driving.  
How would you let the user know there’s a fire happening in a nearby town that is causing road closures? The effect on their commute is unknown, but there is a definite danger if the fire gets closer. How do you communicate this to them? When? Write it.
  
**Headline**: 30 characters max  
**Body**: 45 characters max    
![Flight Cancellation](/imgs/tvh-ux-writing/homepage-hero-pre-2-0_orig.jpg)  
### Rationale
Because this is an emergency, I didn’t mince words or give the users options. I tell them to reroute.

## Score update push notification
### Scenario
A sports fan is at a wedding while their favorite team is playing against their arch-rivals. Their team scores.
How would you, quickly, let the sports fan know about the latest play, the current score, and the key players?
**Headline**: 30 characters max  
**Body**: 45 characters max    
![Flight Cancellation](/imgs/tvh-ux-writing/homepage-hero-pre-2-0_orig.jpg)  
### Rationale
The user will—at most—glance at this alert, so it needs to be short and to the point. They’ll want to know who scored, the score of the game, and how much time is left in the game. Any hockey fan would understand that Larkin scored his 19th goal of the season with an assist from Suter in the first period of the game. If we had a staff writer on hand to write the body text, we could add a little more pizazz: “Suter feeds Larkin with 7:46 to go in the 1st“ or something similar. But if it was automated, this would suffice.

## Live music pop-up modal
### Scenario
The user is a casual music fan and (on occasion) goes to live concerts. They have a music player app on their phone.  
Tell the user that one of their favorite bands is playing live in their town. How would you compel them to want to go?  
**Headline:** 30 characters max  
**Body:** 45 characters max  
**Button:** 25 characters    
![Flight Cancellation](/imgs/tvh-ux-writing/homepage-hero-pre-2-0_orig.jpg)  
### Rationale
The pop-up reads like a flyer tacked onto a telephone pole. I tried to create a sense of urgency in the heading and only included the essentials in the body to make it easily scannable.

## Payment method error
The user is trying to rent a car using an application but the credit card on file has expired.  
Write them an error message so that they can correct the problem.  
**Headline:** 30 characters  
**Body:** 45 characters    
![Flight Cancellation](/imgs/tvh-ux-writing/homepage-hero-pre-2-0_orig.jpg)  
### Rationale
My goal was to avoid sounding accusatory, so rather than “Your credit card has expired,” I chose “Expired payment method.” This also frontloads the most important word—*Expired*.  
The message also implies that the payment method *on file* has expired, not that the user needs to replace their card, which would be stressful.  
‘Payment method’ works best because it can be used for credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, PayPal, etc.  

## Asking for a user’s data
### Scenario
The user is trying to view a website to help them buy a car. But, the content can’t load without the user’s location. They need to enter their ZIP code and first name.  
Ask them where they live and who they are without sounding like you're unnecessarily mining their data.  
**Headline:** 25 characters  
**Body:** 45 characters  
**Button**: 15 characters    
![Flight Cancellation](/imgs/tvh-ux-writing/homepage-hero-pre-2-0_orig.jpg)  
### Rationale
People are pretty savvy; they know they’re paying with their data in this situation, and they might be put off by it. I’ve made the copy as persuasive as possible to let them know they're getting a unique value proposition that’s only available if they provide their name and zip code.

## SEO for a subscription contact lens service 
### Scenario
An elderly user is doing a Google search to find an easy way to buy contact lenses online.  
Write a title and meta description for a website that sells subscription contact lenses delivered to a user every 30 days—convince them to try it.  
**Title: 60** characters max  
**Meta Description**: 160 characters max    

![Flight Cancellation](/imgs/tvh-ux-writing/homepage-hero-pre-2-0_orig.jpg) 
### Rationale
With SEO and meta-descriptions, there’s no leeway with character limits. Therefore, writing persuasive, purposeful copy comes at a premium. Mentioning that the company offers virtual ophthalmology is an enticing add-on perk: users are looking for a way to purchase contacts online, which means they’re likely open-minded about online eye appointments too.

## Fake name error message 
### Scenario
A user is creating an account. When they come to the step where they are asked to enter their name, they get an error message. A fraud detection software thinks their name is fake—but it’s wrong 5% of the time.  
Write an error message that prompts them to fix the error without shaming them for having a fake-sounding name.  
  
**45 characters max**   
![Flight Cancellation](/imgs/tvh-ux-writing/homepage-hero-pre-2-0_orig.jpg) 
### Rationale
This is a sensitive one. The last thing I wanted to do was offend a person with a non-Anglo-Saxon name by saying their name sounded "fake."  
One solution is to avoid explaining why the error has occurred and instead frame it as a security measure on the *user's b*ehalf. If this is too dishonest, I think the second option is polite and doesn't accuse the user of having a fake-sounding name.

## Traffic delays, a truck driver, and a push notification 
### Scenario
A short-haul truck driver has a phone app that monitors his route, schedule, fuel & deliveries. He has 6 more deliveries before stopping for fuel and lunch. Due to unexpected traffic, he’s behind schedule. He can choose to stay on his planned route for a few more stops, but risk running low on fuel and missing lunch, or he can get fuel and lunch now and finish the deliveries later.  
Write a push notification alerting him of this dilemma and his options.
  
**Headline:** 30 characters max  
**Body:** 45 characters max  
**Button(s):** 25 characters max    
![Flight Cancellation](/imgs/tvh-ux-writing/homepage-hero-pre-2-0_orig.jpg) 
### Rationale
There’s a lot to tell the driver:

- Traffic is causing delays.
- They have 6 deliveries before they planned to refuel and eat lunch.
- They might run out of fuel if they attempt to complete those 6 deliveries.
- They’re behind schedule and will be even more behind schedule if they sit in traffic.
- Their options are to postpone refueling and lunch or postpone deliveries and go refuel.  
It's impossible to explain everything in a short push notification, so I tried to give the driver the most important information and a simple decision. Their vehicle's dashboard would display their fuel levels and the driver is likely aware of the traffic.  So instead of asking the driver if they want to avoid traffic and get off the road, I focused on what the app is designed for: delivery management and scheduling. The driver planned to refuel at a certain time, so it’s the app's responsibility to tell them when that is and if they’re on schedule. 
I used the term "pit stop," which encapsulates both *a break* and *refueling.*
