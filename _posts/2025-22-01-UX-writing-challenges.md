## Introduction
I put my UX writing skills to the test with Ryan Farrell’s [Daily UX Writing Challenges](https://dailyuxwriting.com/). The following is a sample of responses that I mocked up in Figma.  


## Flight Cancellation Message
### Scenario
A traveler is in an airport waiting for the last leg of a flight home when their flight gets abruptly canceled due to bad weather.
Write a message from the airline app notifying them of the cancellation and what they need to do next.    
**Headline:** 45 characters max  
**Body:** 175 characters max  
**Button(s):** 25 characters max

### Why This Solution Works  
I found the character limits for this challenge needlessly confining and unrealistic. Brevity at the cost of clarity and usability is a UX no-no, and this is a scenario where the airline does not want to come off as curt. Nevertheless, I provided two solutions: one within the limits and a longer version that better balances empathy, clarity, and user empowerment, making a frustrating experience more manageable.  
#### Empathy and Transparency:
- Opening with an acknowledgment of the inconvenience builds trust and shows empathy.
- Explaining the reason for cancellation (bad weather) reassures travelers it’s out of the airline’s control.
- Explaining that there is no advantage to contacting a Reservations specialist saves users time and effort—avoiding unnecessary trips to the check-in desk, re-clearing security, or frustrating phone calls—while easing the load on customer support.
#### Clarity and Simplicity:
- Two clear options are provided up front, with easy-to-understand language and no ambiguity about the next steps.
#### Actionable CTAs:  
- The "Find a New Flight" button encourages quick action for those who need to rebook.
- Reassuring that a refund will be automatic (with a timeline) prevents confusion or additional effort for the user.
#### Positive Framing:
- Instead of focusing solely on the inconvenience, the message emphasizes solutions and safety, softening the blow of the cancellation. Even the heading is encouraging, giving the user a feeling of empowerment rather than defeat. 
#### Accessibility:
- Short sentences, simple language ('bad' not 'inclement', 'new flight' not 'alternative flight'), straightforward instructions, and optional customer support links make the message accessible to all users, regardless of stress levels or language proficiency.


## Sports App Promo Screen
By balancing clarity, relevance, and a compelling CTA, this solution is designed to attract users and encourage them to engage with the app immediately.
### Scenario
A user is a working parent, and a big sports fan, in the midst of their favorite sports season who can no longer attend games.  
Write a promotional screen for an app that lets a user choose teams, sends game reminders, real-time score updates and highlight videos.    
**Headline:** 40 characters max  
**Body:** 175 characters max  
**Button(s):** 25 characters max     
![Sports app promo screen](/imgs/UX writing challenges/sports app promo screen.png)  
### Why This Solution Works  
#### Tailored to the User's Situation:
The header directly addresses the target audience: sports fans who can't attend games but still want to stay connected. It emphasizes that they can follow their favorite team no matter where they are, resonating with the user's lifestyle.
#### Concise and Impactful Body Copy:
The body copy is short, to the point, and covers the app’s core features: game reminders, score updates, and highlight reels. It avoids unnecessary detail while clearly communicating the app's value.
#### Appealing to the On-the-Go User:
By mentioning “sports fans on the move,” it aligns with busy adults who need a quick, efficient way to stay updated.
#### Action-Oriented CTA:
The button, “Try FanAddict Free,” is simple, enticing, and encourages immediate action. Highlighting that the app is free lowers the barrier to entry and motivates users to give it a shot.
#### Effective Use of Space:
The copy is minimal yet effective, making it easy to scan quickly, which is perfect for users with limited time and attention.

## Wrong Email Address
### Scenario
The user entered the wrong email address to sign in to their account. Tell the user to enter the right email.  
**40 characters max**   
![Wrom Email Address](/imgs/UX writing challenges/wrong email.png)  
### Why This Solution Works
The best solution to this error is good design and development. Visual aids, such as a red outline around the form field, are more effective than clear UX writing. 
#### Clarity and Simplicity:
The message uses clear, everyday language that’s easy to understand. "We don't recognize that email" directly tells the user what went wrong, while "Try again" provides an actionable next step.
#### Conciseness:
The copy is brief and avoids overwhelming the user with unnecessary details, which is ideal for error messages.
#### Friendly Tone:
The phrasing avoids blame or frustration. Instead of saying "You entered the wrong email," it focuses the attention on the system ("*We* don’t recognize that email"), making the user feel less at fault.
#### Actionable Guidance:
"Try again" immediately invites the user to correct their mistake, guiding them toward the next step without further confusion.

## Grocery Delivery Promo Overlay
### Scenario
A user is in their favorite supermarket. They open the supermarket’s app on their phone to see what’s on sale and are greeted by a promotion. Write a promotional home screen for a subscription service that delivers groceries to the user once a month for a flat fee.
  
**Headline:** 45 characters max  
**Body:** 175 characters max  
**Button(s):** 25 characters max      
![Grocery Delivery Subscription](/imgs/UX writing challenges/grocery delivery subscription.png)  

### Why This Solution Works
The difficulty with this one is communicating that this subscription service only covers *one delivery per month*, not **monthly* deliveries. Since the main goal of a promo screen is to get users to the sign-up screen, one could argue that a better strategy would be to explain the fine print later. But I believe transparency is the best way to retain customers over the long run and that the value proposition is still high enough to convert loyal shoppers who already have the supermarket app. 
#### Engaging, Relatable, and Context-Aware Headline:
"Let us get those bags for you." uses a conversational and friendly tone. It appeals to shoppers who dislike the hassle of carrying groceries, immediately highlighting the value of convenience. Further, the heading complements the user's current experience of being in the supermarket, presenting the service as a way to make future trips easier or unnecessary.
#### Clear and Compelling Value Proposition:
The body emphasizes simplicity and savings: "For just $10/month" makes the cost transparent, while "choose as many items as you like" removes concerns about limitations. This clarity helps users see the value of the service without overloading them with details.
#### Actionable Instructions:
The body explains exactly how the service works: open the app, shop, and select a delivery date. This step-by-step breakdown minimizes confusion and builds confidence in trying something new.
#### First Person Primary Call to Action (CTA):
"Sign me up!" is enthusiastic, action-driven, and framed in the first person, making the user feel like they’re actively choosing a great idea for themselves.
#### Thoughtful Secondary CTA:
Including "No, thanks" as an alternative button shows respect for the user’s choice while subtly reinforcing the primary button as the more attractive option. Rather than using "Remind me later," which most users would tap if they're busy shopping in a supermarket, the secondary CTA leverages the psychological tactic of FOMO: if the user says "No" now, they might not get another chance to take advantage of this value prop (of course, that wouldn't be the case, but loss aversion is a powerful tool).

## A Fiery Push Notification
### Scenario
It’s Monday. A user has just gotten into their car to drive to work. They plug their phone into the car and start driving.  
How would you let the user know there’s a fire happening in a nearby town that is causing road closures? The effect on their commute is unknown, but there is a definite danger if the fire gets closer. How do you communicate this to them? When? Write it.
  
**Headline**: 30 characters max  
**Body**: 45 characters max    
![Fiery Push Notification](/imgs/UX writing challenges/fires ahead.png) 
### Why This Solution Works
The character limits seemed completely legitimate for this type of notification. But they did make this one a tough challenge.  
#### Clear, Direct, and Actionable Headline:
The header communicates urgency and potential danger while giving the user agency. I considered using the words "EMERGENCY" or "DANGER" but didn't want to cause unnecessary panic. The "Tap to reroute" CTA  empowers the user to easily and safely check affected routes. This prevents distraction while offering a way to adapt to their commute.
#### Essential Details Only:
The body copy provides concise information: where the fire is and its impact on road closures. This respects the user's focus while driving.
#### Balanced Tone:
The tone is calm yet serious, focusing on safety and awareness rather than alarm, which helps the user stay focused while driving.


## Score Update Push Notification
### Scenario
A sports fan is at a wedding while their favorite team is playing against their arch-rivals. Their team scores.
How would you, quickly, let the sports fan know about the latest play, the current score, and the key players?
**Headline**: 30 characters max  
**Body**: 45 characters max    
![sports Push Notification](/imgs/UX writing challenges/sports push notification.png)  
### Why This Solution Works:
The user will—at most—glance at this alert, so it needs to be short and to the point. They’ll want to know who scored, the score of the game, and how much time is left in the game. Any hockey fan would understand that Larkin scored his 19th goal of the season with an assist from Suter in the first period of the game. If character limits weren't so constraining, you could add a little more personality: “Suter feeds Larkin with 7:46 to go in the 1st“ or something similar. But if this is an automated message, simplicity is probably the safer bet.

## Live Music Pop-Up Modal
### Scenario
The user is a casual music fan and (on occasion) goes to live concerts. They have a music player app on their phone.  
Tell the user that one of their favorite bands is playing live in their town. How would you compel them to want to go?  
**Headline:** 30 characters max  
**Body:** 45 characters max  
**Button:** 25 characters    
![Live Music](/imgs/UX writing challenges/music app.png)  
### Why This Solution Works
The pop-up reads like a flyer tacked onto a telephone pole. I tried to create a sense of urgency in the heading and only included the essentials in the body to make it easily scannable.

## Payment Method Error
The user is trying to rent a car using an application but the credit card on file has expired.  
Write them an error message so that they can correct the problem.  
**Headline:** 30 characters  
**Body:** 45 characters    
![payment method expired](/imgs/UX writing challenges/payment method expired.png)
### Why This Solution Works
The marriage of UX design and UX writing is on display here. The red letters and exclamation point will alert even the most impatient user that something has gone wrong.
#### Clear and Direct Error Headline:
"Update Your Payment Method" immediately tells the user what they need to do, minimizing confusion or frustration. 
#### Concise and Actionable Body:
The body copy identifies the issue ("Card expired") and provides two possible options: change the date—many times the card number is the same but the card is reissued with a new date—or change the payment method altogether. This guarantees the user knows how to fix the problem quickly and avoids terms like 'valid' or 'invalid' which can be interpreted as both vague and ableist.


## Fake Name Error Message
### Scenario
A user is creating an account. When they come to the step where they are asked to enter their name, they get an error message. A fraud detection software thinks their name is fake—but it’s wrong 5% of the time.  
Write an error message that prompts them to fix the error without shaming them for having a fake-sounding name.  
  
**45 characters max**   
![Fake name](/imgs/UX writing challenges/fake name.png)
### Why This Solution Works
This is a sensitive one. The last thing I wanted to do was offend a user with a very real name (I chose the real name of a Korean Pop Star) that the system flags as "fake." The role of the UX Writer here is not necessarily to solve the problem with words but to be sensitive and not shame, irritate, or discourage the user further.
#### Reframes the Error as a Security Measure
This is ultimately a software problem. If the user has entered their actual name with no typos, no amount of re-entering the name will resolve the error. So we need to provide the user with a workaround to validate their name without suggesting that the system thinks the name is fake. By sending a simple email verification, the message completely circumvents suggesting the name is fake—or worse "invalid"—and reframes the error as a security measure, turning a negative into a positive. This would be an easily implemented solution for any software team. 


## Truck Driver Behind Schedule 
### Scenario
A short-haul truck driver has a phone app that monitors his route, schedule, fuel & deliveries. He has 6 more deliveries before stopping for fuel and lunch. Due to unexpected traffic, he’s behind schedule. He can choose to stay on his planned route for a few more stops, but risk running low on fuel and missing lunch, or he can get fuel and lunch now and finish the deliveries later.  
Write a push notification alerting him of this dilemma and his options.
  
**Headline:** 30 characters max  
**Body:** 45 characters max  
**Button(s):** 25 characters max    
![Delivery Driver App](/imgs/UX writing challenges/delivery driver app 2.png)
### Why This Solution Works
This challenge highlighted the problem with all hypothetical UX writing: we know very little about the users and what they desire from the app. Do they want to be told what to do, like a Formula 1 driver following orders from his engineer? Or do they want information and autonomy?  In the end, I chose the latter, attempting to empathize with the driver while still providing them with enough information to make a choice. In an ideal world, the app would know the most efficient plan. For example, based on traffic data, the app might suggest it would be more efficient to get off the road now and wait for traffic to clear. Alternatively, if the data suggests it will only get worse, the driver might want to make as many deliveries as possible and skip lunch. Another point: is the driver at risk of running out of fuel if they push through?
#### Headline Respects Driver's Experience/Expertise:
"3 stops behind—your call" gives the driver the necessary information to make a tough decision.
#### Supportive Tone in the Body:
Phrases like "Grab fuel & lunch now" and "push through a few stops" feel conversational and empathetic, acknowledging the driver's hard work without adding pressure.
#### Clear and Friendly Buttons:
The button labels are approachable and action-driven, offering a gentle nudge toward self-care ("Fuel Up & Eat") or letting the driver continue as planned ("Keep Going").
