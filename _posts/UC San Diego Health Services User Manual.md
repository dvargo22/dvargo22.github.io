# User Manual for a UC San Diego Health Services App
## Background
​The Community Experience Partnership (CEP) Service Planning Tool (SPT) is a custom application designed by UC San Diego in collaboration with the County of San Diego Behavioral Health Services (SDCBHS). The SPT uses data to help behavioral health planners at BHS identify areas in San Diego County where behavioral health needs are likely to be elevated. Users may explore community profiles and download custom reports to summarize the sociodemographic profiles of the selected areas.

## The Deliverable
I was asked to create a user manual to help planners at BHS successfully use the SPT. The SPT is a minimum viable product (MVP), a brand-new tool that was developed with the input of planners but without post-development feedback. I did not have user data or feedback on the tool or on accompanying user documentation.

As a non-expert "outsider," I relied on my user experience to guide the document’s structure and content. I also interviewed the stakeholder behind the tool’s creation to gather insights and scope out the work.
