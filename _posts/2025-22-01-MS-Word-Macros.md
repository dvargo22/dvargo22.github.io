## Introduction
As part of the [University of Washington Professional Technical Writing certificate program](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing), students were asked to create a deliverable that would be useful to a technical writer.
I chose to write an instruction guide on how to add macros to a Microsoft Word template. I wanted to create something that could be repurposed as an online article. To that end, the document combines both instructional and rhetorical elements. The goal was to instruct readers how to add macros to Word and explain why macros are so valuable to technical writers.

## Background

### Target Reader
The target reader is a technical writer or editor who relies heavily on Microsoft Word for their job (i.e. for whom MS Word is a [“core application”](https://articles.centercentre.com/multiple_personalities/)).
The target reader does not have a computer programming background and is not fluent in Microsoft Visual Basic (VBA). They are early in their career, hesitant to learn a programming language like Visual Basic, and fearful that macros may introduce errors to their documents. However, they are enthusiastic about learning something that will improve the quality and efficiency of their work.

### Problem Statement
In the age of automation and AI, technical writers are feeling more pressure than ever to increase productivity and demonstrate value. While many look to the latest and greatest tech to optimize their workflow, they sometimes overlook tried and tested tools, such as macros.

## Objectives
- Provide a simple step-by-step guide on how to record and organize macros in Microsoft Word
- Persuade readers that macros are invaluable tools that save time and improve the quality of their work
  
## My Approach 

I had two weeks to complete this project. Because my priority was to instruct readers how to add a macro, I wrote that section first and sent it out to three non-expert Microsoft Word testers. All three successfully added a macro to their Word interface but encountered moments of friction. These moments were addressed in a subsequent revision and tested by three new readers for validation. In qualitative feedback, all six testers noted that my guide was approachable and conversational, without being wordy. In response to the question, “Has this guide convinced you to use macros?” five out of six testers said, “Yes.”
