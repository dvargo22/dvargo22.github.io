## Background
​The Community Experience Partnership (CEP) Service Planning Tool (SPT) is a custom application designed by UC San Diego in collaboration with the County of San Diego Behavioral Health Services (SDCBHS). The SPT uses data to help behavioral health planners at BHS identify areas in San Diego County where behavioral health needs are likely to be elevated. Users may explore community profiles and download custom reports to summarize the sociodemographic profiles of the selected areas.

## Objective

## My Approach 
Adobe Indesign

## Constraints and Challenges
The SPT was a minimum viable product (MVP), a brand-new tool that was developed with the *input* of behavioral health planners but without their post-development feedback. Therefore, I did not have user data or feedback on the tool itself.

## Final Deliverable
I created a user manual to help planners at SDCBHS successfully implement the SPT into their behavioral health planning. 

I relied on my user experience to guide the document’s structure and content. I also interviewed the SPT product manager on the BHS Clinical Design team to gather insights and scope out the work.
